# Project Guide
- i created a RDS instance
- i used an existing api (the api-cinema-challenge) and connected this to the tablePlus database through the appsetting.json
- and then i deployed the backend
- i created the elastic beanstalk application and enviroment
- i then created the s3 bucket and uploaded the files and folders
- my enviroments health kept turning severe so i couldn't actually see my frontend part but i know the connection was completed because for a minute when my beanstalk was working the url worked.
